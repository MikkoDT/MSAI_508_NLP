consider . \\nbad movie syndrome struck me again , so after witnessing how much \\\" battlefield earth \\\" has been proclaimed a train wreck in both critical and popular circles , i felt the masochistic urge to see the disaster first-hand . \\nis it as bad as advertised ? \\noh yes , very much so . \\nthe plot is incomprehensible . \\nthe acting is atrocious . \\nthe special effects are mediocre . \\nthe action is dull . \\nthe implausibilities are legion . \\nthe dialogue is cringe-inducing . \\nthe whole package is funny when it wants to be serious and irritating when it wants to be funny . \\ni don't even want to continue reviewing this movie ; i'd like to purge the atrocity from my mind as soon as possible , but you probably want to read my thrashing in all its sarcastic glory , so here it is : \\nthe premise is basically a rip-off of \\\" planet of the apes , \\\" only minus the apes and philosophical discussion , and plus a race of evil aliens from the planet psychlo . \\nthe year is 3000 , the psychlos have conquered earth , and the human population has been enslaved . \\nonly a handful of humans escaped to radiation-rich areas to escape the aliens ; they live out their lives in fear . \\none man , johnny goodboy ( i know , i know ) tyler ( barry pepper ) , ventures to the outworld and is captured by the psychlos . \\nthere he confronts the psychlo head of security : a big , ugly , klingon-looking creature called terl ( john travolta ) . \\npressed into slavery , johnny vows to lead a revolution and take the planet back . \\nmeanwhile , terl is faced with his own problems : he has recently learned that he's stuck living on earth ( which he hates ) for the rest of his career because he pissed off his boss by sleeping with the big man's daughter . \\nhe decides to give johnny knowledge of the psychlo language and technology ( this is where the plot gets ridiculous . \\n . \\n . ) \\nso the \\\" man-animal \\\" can lead a mining expedition into places the psychlos can't go . \\nterl then plans to keep the mined gold for himself . \\nof course , his plan doesn't work . \\nso many things wrong with this movie -- where to begin ? \\nhow about with travolta , whose hollywood clout brought about this , the cinematic version of scientology guru l . ron hubbard's sci-fi novel ? \\nearly previews for \\\" battlefield earth , \\\" with constant shots of a makeup-laden travolta cackling like lex luthor , had me ( and several audience members ) remarking , \\\" what the hell is travolta thinking ? \\\" \\nthe movie did nothing to stem such remarks . \\nall that ridiculous cackling he did in the trailers is in full force here : terl cackles after nearly every line , and so does every other psychlo . \\nof course , this makes every scene hilariously overwrought , no more so than when the script clumsily stumbles into political commentary . \\nthe psychlos are probably supposed to be some kind of satire of corporate america , but ceos generally don't laugh maniacally after denying pay raises to their employees . \\n ( \\\" you were going to be promoted -- but now you're not ! \\nfwahahahahahahahaha ! ! ! ! ! \\\" ) \\nit's no big surprise terl loses to the humans -- he's an idiot . \\nhe breaks every kind of supervillain rule in the book . \\nhe underestimates his enemies , assuming he'll win just because he's smarter . \\n ( he uses the word \\\" leverage \\\" like some sort of scientologist mantra . ) \\nnot content to go the james bond villain route of explaining his plans to the hero , he hooks him up to a machine that gives him knowledge of all the psychlos' language and technology . \\n ( why this machine is even around in the first place is beyond me . ) \\nhe then appears shocked that johnny points a gun at him . \\nno wonder this guy never got his promotion . \\nthe plot inconsistencies are too numerous to mention . \\nwhy do the psychlos build an earth base in which both they and the human slaves must wear little breathing apparatuses to survive ? \\nhow come the psychlos are wasting their time mining for gold when the doors of fort knox are wide open ? \\nhow in the world did all those fighter jets survive sitting in a hangar for 1 , 000 years ? \\nand how do all these previously brain-dead cavemen learn to fly them so quickly ? \\nthere's a whole lot more to scratch one's head about in \\\" battlefield earth . \\\" \\nbring a scorecard to track the plot holes . \\ndirector roger christian shoots \\\" battlefield earth \\\" in the most distracting way possible , tilting nearly every shot sideways for no discernible reason . \\nall the characters appear to be standing on the walls , and it's awfully difficult to watch a movie when you must tilt your head just to watch ordinary passages of dialogue . \\nthe action sequences are atrociously edited , every one turned into an endless slow-motion parade that drains all potential excitement . \\nare these things really so hard to construct ? \\nmy respect for supposed \\\" lightweight \\\" action directors has grown by leaps and bounds after witnessing in \\\" battlefield earth \\\" how badly an action sequence can be shot . \\nthis movie is an absolute headache . \\nit's not just the shot selection and editing ; the movie , quite frankly , makes no sense . \\nfor most of \\\" battlefield earth's \\\" running time , i just didn't know what was happening . \\nit didn't have anything to do with me finding the events stupid or illogical ( though they certainly are ) -- i really had no idea what the hell was going on . \\nwhen i pieced the plot together later , it didn't look any better . \\nhere's how much of a disaster this is : \\\" battlefield earth \\\" is already the worst movie of the year , and it's going to take something really , really inept to top it . \\nthe only thing we can take comfort in about the film is that no one will be suckered into joining the church of scientology because of it . \\nin fact , i'd think that hubbard's cult would want to distance themselves from this bomb as fast as possible . \\nthat'll teach me to give into bad movie syndrome again . \\n\",\n          \"chris tucker is one of those guys you immediately get a reaction from -- you either find his helium voice , crazy eyes and jerky mannerisms funny or annoying . \\ni think i fall into the former category ( i'm one of the few who thought his turn in \\\" the fifth element \\\" as a prancing , prince-like deejay was complete inspired lunacy and not the least bit aggravating ) , but his new vehicle \\\" money talks \\\" just doesn't do him service . \\ntucker is good in the movie -- and this is the kind of film that , if people see it , could make him a big star -- but he's also really the only thing good about the movie . \\nin fact , if you see \\\" money talks , \\\" it should shock you beyond recognition that two of \\\" toy story \\\" 's writers penned the sloppy script . \\ntucker's role here is that of franklin hatchett , a petty los angeles con artist whose carwash scams get him dogged by investigative reporter james russell ( charlie sheen ) . \\nafter being busted on the job for some illegal business involving counterfeit passports , franklin finds himself on a bus to the county jail and handcuffed to slick international jewel smuggler raymond villard ( gerard ismael ) . \\nbut villard's thugs blow up the bus in an attempt to free their leader ( never mind that the explosion could have instead killed him ) , and because he and franklin are joined at the wrist , franklin is allowed to escape as well , but not before overhearing some important information regarding a diamond stash that -- for some reason or another -- is being hidden in a vintage roadster waiting to be auctioned off at an upcoming auto expo . \\nthe local media mistakenly puts the prison break-out blame on franklin , which is where james comes back into the picture . \\nhe makes a deal to protect franklin if , in turn , franklin gives him an exclusive interview . \\nthis means james must present his new \\\" friend \\\" in the stickiest of situations -- a formal dinner party for he and fiancee grace ( heather locklear ) , also attended by her uber-rich parents ( veronica cartwright and nicely game paul sorvino ) . \\nand of course the bad guys track franklin down and try to knock him off , all the while he spars and forms an unlikely bond with james . \\n \\\" this ain't no buddy movie , \\\" claim the print ads . \\nyeah , right . \\nactually , for the better part of , oh , 20 minutes , it appears \\\" money talks \\\" has the momentum to cover entertaining ground , and this is mostly due to the presence of spastic motormouth tucker . \\nthis is tucker's first leading role , and if you imagine a slightly lankier , african-american jim carrey with a reliance on wild r-rated raunch rather than pg-13 physical comedy , you have a good idea of the conviction with which he assaults the role . \\nbut you realize all too quickly that tucker's overstated liveliness is the only thing \\\" money talks \\\" has going for it . \\nand a lively actor alone does not a successful movie make . \\nit's all too easy to pick out everything wrong with \\\" money talks . \\\" \\nthe plot is recycled buddy-buddy comedy-thriller tripe that seemed overused even when \\\" nothing to lose \\\" employed it last month . \\neverything is paint-by-numbers , especially the los angeles coliseum finale , which finds not one , not two , but three separate enemy factions firing at franklin as they pursue him through the bleachers . \\nthe villains , as many as there are , are dull . \\ncertain story elements are too coincidental . \\nand too much of the film's dramatic agenda is played too straight . \\na scene where grace confronts james after learning franklin's true identity ( \\\" you brought a killer into my parents' house ! \\\" ) \\nis extremely silly . \\nyou get the picture . \\nobviously , i did not have a pleasant experience at \\\" money talks . \\\" \\nbut the people around me appeared to be having a rip-roaring good time ( one gentleman several rows behind me chortled with such expressive conviction i began fearing for his health ) . \\nbut tucker , at least for me , is a pretty funny guy , and aces the movie's best scene , where franklin passes himself off as vic damone's son at james and grace's engagement bash and toasts the couple with barry white lyrics . \\ntucker's audience -- and he does have one -- will probably like \\\" money talks . \\\" \\nthose who he irritates , however , will have a more productive day staying home and scraping the gook out from under their toenails . \\n\",\n          \"if this keeps up , jane austen ( sense and sensibility , pride and prejudice ) may have to apply for posthumous membership to the screen writers guild . \\nyet another novel of hers has made the transition to the silver screen . \\nmansfield park is a turn of the century ( 18th century going on 19th ) story about love among the classes as well as an examination into proper society and family ties . \\nten year old fanny price ( hannah taylor-gordon , jakob the liar ) , taken from her mother and father and the poverty in which they dwell , is sent to live with her aunt and the privileged class at mansfield park , under the stern patriarchal hand of her uncle , sir thomas bertram ( harold pinter , mojo ) \\nspending her days reminded of her lower status , she also invents and writes fanciful stories during her private times . \\nfanny eventually grows to become a beautiful , intelligent , and engaging heroine ( quite unlike the original character which ms . austen originally penned in her novel . ) \\nwriter/director patricia rozema ( when night is falling ) is responsible for the textual changes . \\nfrom a purely dramatic perspective , the revision makes perfect sense and improves the film's audience appeal . \\nwhat ms . rozema has done is to infuse the main character with much of ms . austen's own personality by including excerpts from the author's journals , giving that dialogue to fanny . \\nthe result is a central character that is immediately appealing . \\nas the grown fanny , australian actress frances o'connor ( all about adam ) does wonderfully textured work . \\nat times , ms . rozema has fanny address the camera directly to communicate many of the novel's more introspective observations . \\nthis is a difficult device to work seamlessly into a period film and it is to ms . o'connor's credit that it works as well as it does . \\nthe central theme which gives the story its legs in an old one . . . \\nwhether it is better to marry for love or for social standing ? \\nfanny has fallen in love with her cousin edmund ( jonny lee miller , plunkett & macleane ) who appears fond of her as well . \\nhis attentions are soon divided as the stylish and socially acceptable mary crawford ( embeth davidtz , bicentennial man ) enters the picture along with her equally acceptable brother henry ( alessandro nivola , inventing the abbotts ) who eventually sets his romantic sights upon fanny . \\nwhile mary and henry are evidently less than sincere in their affections , their presence does provide the movie and the main characters with the necessary conflict that keeps our interest until the film's appropriately austen-like ending . \\nother thematic devices include a awkwardly inserted reference to the source of the wealth of mansfield park . . . \\nthe slave trade . \\nthere is also a hint of both lesbianism and incest but neither is carried very far and is soon forgotten . \\nthe motivation for marriage remains the primary thematic thrust . \\nfanny's cousin , maria bertram ( victoria hamilton , persuasion ) is an example of one making a poor match , marrying a well-to-do fool who is able to make her comfortable , but never happy . \\nfanny's own mother , trapped in her chosen life of squalor warns fanny by admitting that her situation is due to the fact that she \\\" married for love . \\\" \\nfanny , given those two terrible examples , and faced with the same choice is understandably indecisive as to which way to lean . \\nthe spiritual answer , of course , lies in the middle of those two extremes . \\nmarriage is not a cold , calculating decision based upon self-preservation . \\nneither is it a senseless decision made in the warm afterglow of a passionate embrace . \\nin the purest sense , marriage forms an insoluble union whereby two people agree to function as one . \\n \\\" and said , for this cause shall a man leave father and mother , and shall cleave to his wife : and they twain shall be one flesh ? \\\" \\nmatthew 19 : 5 [kjv] \\nlove and logic can be combined . \\ngod's word contains both . \\nso does a marriage based upon his truth . \\n\"\n        ],\n

) . \\nas if that weren't enough , ellie's discovery leads her to the nation's capital where she again runs into palmer . \\ncontact is based on the novel by carl sagan and deals heavily with the subject of science vs . religion . \\nthe impressive thing is how well both aspects are presented , with no signs of bias . \\narguments for both sides are intelligent , solid , and thought-provoking . \\nwhen palmer joins a selection committee to choose an ambassador to vega ( of which ellie is a leading candidate ) , personal convictions play a more important role than love interests . \\nthe question is , can a person who doesn't believe in god truly be the best representative of earth when 90% of the planet * does * believe in a higher power ? \\neven when the film wraps up , it's uncertain whether it's meant to play as an advocate for religion , science , both , or even neither , and in our modern day society where \\\" right and wrong \\\" is only opinion ( at least speaking \\\" politically correctly \\\" ) , the ambiguity is an incentive . \\ndon't get me wrong . \\nas much as it sounds like it , contact isn't merely a theology class rolled into a reel of film . \\nit's a * highly * enjoyable two and a half hours . \\ndespite its seemingly heavy issues , it's not a tedious undertaking to watch this film . \\nthe special effects are outstanding , though ( warning ! ) \\nhighly depreciated on the small screen . \\neven so , some of the subtle visual effects ( that will likely go unnoticed by many ) are even more impressive than ones more recognizable as \\\" sci-fi \\\" . \\nthe storytelling is rich and complete , and although there are moments in the film that feel quite pretentious ( and at times , even hokey ) , it's easily one of the best 1997 films , and one of the best sci-fi films i've ever seen . \\nthis is zemeckis' best since back to the future , and for those of us who actually know that forrest gump was astronomically overrated , zemeckis now has real reason to boast . \\n\",\n          \"the makers of spawn have created something almost as vacuous as this summer's other comic book adaptation , batman and robin . \\nboth films make the mistake of adapting for the screen not only the look of their graphic counterparts , but also their monosyllabic dialogue and empty-headed character motivations . \\nin panel-sized morsels , implausible plots and \\\" rambo \\\" -esque dialogue are often overshadowed by the artwork , but on thirty foot silver screens , it's much more difficult to dismiss the shallowness behind the pretty pictures . \\nspawn is ostensibly about an assassin named simmons ( white ) who is framed by a corporate baddie ( played without irony by sheen ) , then set on fire and left for dead . \\nthough the movie skimps on the next few plot points , here's what i could determine : said assassin then becomes the leader of satan's army , under the tutelage of a flatulating midget named clown ( leguizamo , grating as always ) . \\nhe is renamed , for reasons unbeknownst , spawn , and granted a really cool costume that enables him to become something of a human chameleon . \\nbut when spawn spies on a birthday party for his child , he realizes that he can't be the evil superdemon he's expected to be , and he sets about avenging his untimely death . \\ntypical of summer blockbusters , spawn is an effects-laden ninety minute rock video . \\nwhile the visions of hell are laughably crude ( think the virtual reality sequences of the lawnmower man ) , spawn's prehensile outfit and the action sequences are truly something to behold . \\nbut the storytelling is completely lacking in emotion ( spawn longs for his wife , but they don't have a single scene together before simmons' death ! ) , conflict ( who will triumph is not anybody's guess ) , and believability ( not that i expected it ) . \\nso many questions are left unanswered , and i'm sure they won't be addressed in the inevitable sequel . \\nwhile last year's the crow : city of angels suffered similar problems with its narrative ( which was lazy and somewhat incoherent ) , it had atmosphere to spare and genuine moments of hypnotic power . \\nspawn is an in-your-face , screaming banshee of a film ; these guys know how to graft a comic book onto celluloid , but they haven't the faintest idea how to make a movie . \\n\",\n          \"michael robbins' hardball is quite the cinematic achievement . \\nin about two hours , we get a glancing examination of ghetto life , a funeral with a heartfelt eulogy , speeches about never giving up , a cache of cute kids ( including a fat one with asthma ) , a hard-luck gambler who finds salvation in a good woman and a climactic \\\" big game , \\\" where the underdogs prove to have a bigger bite than anyone ever imagined . \\nall that's needed is a guy getting hit in the nuts and a food fight to have the first film solely based on cinematic clich ? s . \\ni can't wait to see the deleted scenes when it comes out on dvd . \\nobviously , hardball is a strikeout of a movie that never gets the bat anywhere near the ball . \\nit stars keanu reeves as the aforementioned gambler , who seems to owe every bookie in chicago an amount of money that rivals the gross national product of guam . \\nout of solutions , he begs his successful corporate friend ( the always welcome mike mcglone ) to lend him $5 , 000 . \\ninstead , mcglone offers reeves the chance to help him coach a youth baseball team from the projects for a nice weekly stipend . \\nreeves , who wants to keep his fingers , accepts the offer , but discovers mcglone is only too happy to let him handle the team entirely . \\nthe drowsy-voiced protagonist must teach the sassy inner city kids the baseball basics in a life of absentee parents and merciless gangs . \\nand maybe , just maybe , they'll play in the big championship game . \\none of the glorious surprises in the screenplay by john gatins ( summer catch ) , adapted from daniel coyle's non-fiction book , is that there aren't any . \\nthe movie coasts from heartfelt moment to heartfelt moment like a zombie . \\nthat wouldn't be so bad , if the characters had an ounce of subtlety or humanity to them . \\nmost of the kids' time is spent yelling at each other , talking in slang and acting surprised . \\nthere's little that's naturally amusing about them , as they all seem to know the cameras are rolling . \\nthe worst of the lot is a tough-talking younger player ( dewayne warren ) whose sole purpose , as the movie unfolds , is being an emotional pawn , a tactic so utterly despicable i can't find the right words to express myself . \\nthe adults also don't fare well . \\nreeves is impressively uninspiring as the down-on-his-luck loser . \\nthe character is poorly written , but reeves gives another charisma-free performance . \\nevery time he speaks , he sounds like he just got up from a long nap and is gradually waking up . \\nkids are supposed to rally around this guy ? \\ndiane lane , who co-stars as reeves' obligatory love interest , remains a glowing screen presence ( see my dog skip for better proof ) . \\nit's too bad that her role here consists of uttering lines like , \\\" these kids trust you , and they don't trust anyone ! \\\" \\nthen there's d . b . \\nsweeney as an evil rival coach and john hawkes as reeves' scummy betting buddy and other unoriginal characters you've seen before and hope never to see again . \\ni wanted hardball to be good . \\nrobbins' varsity blues was a funny and alternately taut tale of texas high school football that had ali larter smothered in whipped cream and jon voight sneering at everything that moved . \\ni haven't seen robbins' goofy ready to rumble in its entirety , but i am intrigued that \\\" macho man \\\" randy savage and martin landau can exist in the same movie without there being serious worldwide repercussions . \\nrobbins obviously needs to go back to his forte -- making sports movies for guys and not cutesy , cuddly pap such as hardball , which also manages to annoy and insult the audience . \\nhere's hoping that happens in the immediate future . \\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"processed_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"neg\",\n          \"pos\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
