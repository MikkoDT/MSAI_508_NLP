\\njeter doesn't know what he's talking about . \\neastwood furrows his brow . \\ncrinkled expressions and all , clint is the centre of energy of true crime . \\nthe film is by no means a standard action/suspense yarn , but a thoughtful human story in which the characters come before the shoot-outs . \\nisaiah washington has a break-out performance as frank beacham , and scenes with him and his weary wife ( lisa gay hamilton ) are truly heartfelt moments . \\nbut the best scenes are ones that feature eastwood duking it out with those in authority over him . \\ndenis leary , as everett's editor and boss , has more than a few memorable moments of restrained anger ( you see , ev is sleeping with his wife ) . \\nbut hands down , the most enjoyable segments of the film are when james woods is on camera . \\nplaying the big boss alan mann , woods and eastwood create amusing chemistry and laugh-out-loud punchlines . \\nwhen true crime opts for a high-speed chase to the governer's house at the finale , the quality of film-making takes an abrupt nosedive . \\neastwood was so successful with colorful character portraits that he didn't need to switch lanes . \\ntrue crime is a tension-building , intriguing drama showcase for the talented director and star . \\nthis is a road block he could have easily dismissed ( i furrow my brow ) . \\n . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . \\n\",\n          \"first , i am not a big fan of the x-files tv series . \\ni have nothing against it particularly , i just don't happen to watch it . \\nhaving said that , i can now say that i liked the x-files pretty well . \\nfor us non-fans , there's nothing big going for it , but there are a lot of little things . \\nthe movie opens on an ice cave in north texas in 35 , 000 b . c . \\ntwo proto-humans enter the cave and find a space alien cocooned inside . \\nthe alien breaks free and kills one man in a struggle while the other is seemingly captured by the bloody ooze from the alien . \\nthe movie jumps to the same cave today where a boy ( lucas black , from sling blade ) is captured by the same black ooze . \\nwe then cut to fbi agents scully and mulder ( gillian anderson and david duchovny ) , who have been pulled off of their previous assignment ( investigations into the paranormal ) and put onto the bomb squad detail . \\na caller has threatened a federal building in dallas , texas . \\non a hunch , mulder checks out the building across the street , and , wouldn't you know it , he turns out to be right . \\nthe fbi finds the bomb in time to evacuate but not in time to defuse . \\nfive people die in the blast , and when mulder learns who the victims were , a light bulb goes on over his head . \\nthe two agents team up to investigate , against fbi orders , the links mulder has made . \\ntheir search leads them back to the north texas cave , all across the country , and even to antarctica as they get closer and closer to \\\" the truth . \\\" \\nthe plot , and \\\" the truth , \\\" are uninspired . \\ni got the feeling that what i learned was supposed to shock and amaze me . \\nit didn't . \\nthe possible existence of aliens on earth has been explored so many times before in movies that one could hardly count them . \\nbut the point of the x-files is not what the truth is , but the extent to which it has been hidden . \\nit's a slightly more interesting angle , but it still raises expectations about that \\\" truth \\\" too high . \\nif this were the whole film , i would say the movie was mediocre , perhaps even boring . \\nbut there are other qualities that make me like this movie well enough to recommend it . \\nthe pacing of the film was brisk enough to hold my interest . \\nbefore the audience can get tired of one location , the agents follow a hot tip to another location , and so on and so forth . \\nthe locations are not all computer-generated sets , either . \\nthere are some artificial settings , but the desert night of nevada , the edge of suburbia in texas , and the endless fields of snow in antarctica ( actually somewhere in north america . ) \\nmake this fantastic film feel more real . \\nward russell's cinematography is very good . \\nthe overall look is dark and ominous , appropriate to the intended tone of the film's plot . \\nrussell is able to make something as innocuous as a cornfield look foreboding . \\nwhen the movie is set in darkness , the picture quality is still rich and detailed . \\nfinally , and specifically , there is an incredible shot at night in which the camera crosses the tracks in front of a fast oncoming train . \\ni don't know if the shot is faked in any way , but it looks dangerous , and it looks great . \\nthe movie's soundtrack is also used to convey the dark tone of the film . ( skip \\nto the next paragraph if you have yet to see the movie - there is a spoiler in the following sentences . ) during the opening prehistoric sequence , a howling wind dogs the soundtrack , never giving the characters or the audience an escape from the lonely terrible sound . \\nin one of the movie's most effective sequences , metallic doors suddenly slam open to release a cloud of buzzing bees . \\nthe visuals of the scene are good , but what makes it so surprising and frightening is the sound . \\nthere was no question as to who the movie's stars would be . \\neven so , duchovny and anderson are an interesting pair of actors and a good combination . \\nboth are easy on the eyes and together , they have some good timing , banter , and energy . \\nthere is a hint of chemistry between them , but it never gets in the way of their professional relationship . \\nthey are like a couple of kids out exploring the empty lot at the end of the street . \\nthere might be some romantic interest , but for now they're more interested in their environs than they are in each other . \\nno single element really makes this movie outstanding - not even the sense of paranoia that makes the tv show so popular . \\nbut enough things were done right that the x-files is one of the more interesting summer adventures to come along . \\n\",\n          \"at the end of an action scene in \\\" lara croft : tomb raider , \\\" a wall collapses near the nubile warrior . \\nwith her face on the floor , she gazes into the rubble , then grins abruptly and says \\\" oh , my car keys ! \\\" \\ni mention this scene because it was the only moment in the whole damned production that made me smile . \\nbased on an incredibly popular video game , \\\" lara croft : tomb raider \\\" is a lousy movie . \\nthe structure goes like this : poorly-staged action sequence , boring exposition , poorly-staged action sequence , boring exposition , etc . etc . , the end . \\nbasically , the film exists to showcase angelina jolie's puffy lips and enhanced tits . \\nclose-ups are framed oh-so-carefully to include her million dollar bazooms . \\nrunning scenes highlight her bouncing breasts in vintage \\\" baywatch \\\" fashion . \\nthere's even include a shower scene that offers a brief side view of them . \\nbut the filmmakers are so inept they can't even flash the audience correctly . \\nthe one extended display of nudity is of - get ready for this - a guy . \\nfor no particular reason , a muscular supporting character strolls around naked for about 30 seconds , with each shot composed to barely cover his package , ? la \\\" austin powers . \\\" \\nnow , i enjoy a good looking male body as much as the next gay guy , but what the hell is beefcake doing in a t&a flick aimed at heterosexual males ? \\nof course , what else should one expect in a film that does virtually nothing right ? \\n \\\" tomb raider \\\" sets up elaborate action set pieces , then renders them incomprehensible with needless jump cut editing ( a promising dual bungee cord battle is ruined by excessive cuts ) . \\nit promises a series of exotic locales , then delivers cavernous sets and grimy matte paintings with smoggy skies . \\nthrow in some bargain basement computer graphics and you end up with the ugliest movie to come down the pike in many moons . \\nintended to be a rousing \\\" indiana jones \\\" style adventure , \\\" tomb raider \\\" lacks any sense of tension . \\nthe low point comes when lara is \\\" threatened \\\" by statues of monkey warriors and a giant multi-armed shiva figure that come to life courtesy of cgi . \\neasily the lamest menaces i have ever seen , the creatures move like snails and fall apart with a single shot from a gun . \\nif you ever have to be chased by monsters , pray that you get the monkey warriors . \\n \\\" tomb raider \\\" tells a story , sort of . \\nonce every 5 , 000 years , the planets align . \\na group of very bad men are out to find two halves of an object that , if reassembled just as the planets align , will give them control over time itself . \\nlara's goal is to stop them and rescue her long-missing poppa ( jon voight , jolie's real life dad ) . \\nnone of this matters though , because stunning gaps in internal logic assure that the plot of \\\" lara croft : tomb raider \\\" is as lame as ever other aspect of the film ? except angelina jolie's lips and breasts . \\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"neg\",\n          \"pos\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

\\nthere is very , very little that is funny in caddyshack . \\nthe laughs are few , and far between , and what there are really aren't that great . \\ncaddyshack , as the name implies , more or less centers on one young caddy working at an exclusive country club . \\nmichael o'keefe plays said caddy . \\nwhy they cast this unknown , fairly untalented actor in the lead role is completely beyond me . \\nthe movie doesn't seem to have a real plot , just a series of scenes that are little more than opportunities for the rest of the cast to mug at the camera . \\nthe only real story , if you can call it that , was a subplot involving the mentally disturbed greens keeper , bill murray , who is having his own private little war against a gopher who is ruining the course . \\nmost of the marginal laughs come from rodney dangerfield and ted knight mugging and overacting for the camera -- with painfully limited success . \\nbill murray is slightly amusing in places , but fairly wasted . \\nthe biggest waste of all is chevy chase , who didn't even crack a smile on my face with his character's lame zen-like approach to golfing . \\nthere are a few decent scenes involving the interaction between dangerfield and knight , but they are far too infrequent to carry the movie . \\ni guess that's what you get for basing a story around an unknown kid . \\ni'm not sure what the writers of this thing were thinking of , but i really think it was something far removed from comedy as they were putting pen to paper . \\nnothing about this movie works . \\nit wouldn't have taken a genius to figure out that this thing wasn't going to fly . \\nmost of the scenes just couldn't possibly be funny . \\nit's as if the writers where off in their own little brain damaged world . \\ni'm sure scenes involving chevy chase and his oneness with the golf ball were supposed to be funny . \\nin reality , they were painfully embarrassing to watch . \\nthere is a scene at the club pool where all the caddies go wild for the \\\" hot babe \\\" of the movie walking by in her bikini . \\nolive oil would have filled out this swimsuit better than this girl . \\neverything about this movie was just completely implausible as far as the comedy was concerned . \\nmaybe if you were drunk out of you mind or high off some sort of illegal narcotic this thing might be funny . \\nbut for the rest of us , stay the hell away from caddyshack . \\n\",\n          \"whenever writer/director robert altman works in a specific genre , he has the tendency to rewrite it on his own terms . \\nhe made the west dirty in \\\" mccabe and mrs . miller \\\" ( 1971 ) , he parodied hard-boiled detective stories in \\\" the long goodbye \\\" ( 1973 ) , and he transformed a cartoon into flesh and blood with \\\" popeye \\\" ( 1980 ) . \\nthe same holds true for his most recent film , \\\" the gingerbread man , \\\" which reinvents a genre that has developed at an exponential rate over the last five years : the john grisham movie . \\nby the time \\\" the gingerbread man \\\" was completed , there was very little evidence that it was ever based on a story by grisham . \\nthere's no idealist young lawyer ala tom cruise , matthew mcconaughey , chris o'donnell or matt damon , and it doesn't feature a great showdown in a courtroom . \\ninstead of being a grand ode to the powers of the legal profession , \\\" the gingerbread man \\\" is a rain-soaked , southern gothic noir thriller with wildly eccentric characters , a twisting plot line , black humor , a somewhat bleak ending , and even altman's trademark full-frontal female nudity . \\nthe central character of the film is rick magruder , who is unlike any of grisham's other lawyer heroes . \\nhe is older , experienced , and rich ; he drives a cherry-red $80 , 000 mercedes that never gets dirty , even in the incessantly pouring rain of savannah , georgia , where the story unfolds . \\nrick is in the midst of an ugly divorce with his wife , leeanne ( famke janssen ) , and he rarely gets to see his two children , jeff ( jesse james ) and libby ( mae whitman ) . \\na reason is never given for the divorce , but it isn't hard to surmise that rick's womanizing had a large part in it . \\nwhenever he's late to pick up the kids on his visitation days , leeanne always assumes it's because he's been \\\" screwing around . \\\" \\nafter an office party celebrating another of his court victories ( he hasn't lost in eight years ) , rick becomes involved with mallory doss ( embeth davidtz ) , one of the catering waitresses . \\nhe drives her home because her car has been stolen , and they end up in bed together . \\nrick finds out that mallory is being terrorized and stalked by her slightly psychotic father , dixon doss ( robert duvall ) , a grungy , stringy , bare-footed old man who leads a commune of other greasy old codgers . \\nit was actually dixon who stole her car that night , and when rick asks why , mallory replies that he always does \\\" weird \\\" stuff like that . \\nas another character puts it , dixon is \\\" a few beers short of six-pack . \\\" \\nrick ends up convincing mallory to have dixon brought to court and tried for competency . \\nhe succeeds with information dug up by clyde pell , a private investigator friend ( robert downey jr . ) , and testimony from mallory's begrudging ex-husband , pete randle ( tom berenger ) . \\ndixon is put in a mental hospital , but his commune buddies succeed in breaking him out . \\nfrom there , the story delves into kidnapping , murder , double-crossing , and even a hurricane that adds an ominous cloud of constant violence to the action . \\naltman's cinematographer , changwei gu , gives the film a dark , soaked look . \\nif it isn't night-time , at least it's raining . \\ngu shoots the interiors , which are almost all dark wood paneling , with a minimum of light . \\na great deal of the action takes place in the leafy georgia backwoods , which altman uses to create an acute sense of dread and vulnerability . \\nin the city there is danger enough , but when rick has to venture into the woods , you can almost feel him leaving all hope of civilization behind as he literally enters another world . \\naltman has worked in just about every conceivable genre , from westerns to epic dramas to comedies . \\nbut , no matter what the genre , he is always sure to give it the altman stamp , which usually consists of all kinds of idiosyncratic quirks and little details that are often missed without repeat viewings . \\n \\\" the gingerbread man \\\" is no different , although his style is much more restrained here . \\nhowever , without those little touches , the film could have easily slumped into a routine action/thriller . \\na great deal of the credit for the film's success can be given to the actors , especially branagh , who rarely works outside of period pieces and his own direction . \\nhere , the british actor consistently maintains a serviceable southern drawl , while making an essentially contemptible character interesting and sympathetic . \\nrick is an extremely flawed man , but branaugh brings real humanity to his character . \\nwithout it , the entire film would fall flat because so much of it is reliant on the audience feeling rick's pain and frustration . \\nthe supporting actors also put in fine performances , including embeth davidtz , who is probably best known for her heart-breaking role as the jewish maid in \\\" schindler's list \\\" ( 1993 ) . \\ntom berenger provides some gruff comic relief , and robert duvall spends most of his on-screen time just looking weird . \\nit doesn't seem like he does much because he has very little spoken dialogue , but watch him closely during the film's one courtroom scene : his entire performance is in his eyes and his body language , and few actors could have pulled it off without being either silly or overbearing . \\nwhile \\\" the gingerbread man \\\" isn't in league with altman's greatest works like \\\" nashville \\\" ( 1975 ) or \\\" the player \\\" ( 1992 ) , it is nonetheless a solid piece of genre filmmaking , which may prove a successful vehicle to restart his somewhat lagging career . \\nsome critics love to stamp films like this as \\\" commercial , \\\" as if altman can only maintain artistic integrity if his films are aimed at a tiny audience and don't make money . \\naltman has done something much better : he took what could have been a generic movie , and by investing artistry and effort , he made it into something more . \\n\",\n          \"synopsis : melissa , a mentally-disturbed woman who likes to smoke , seduces doug , a minor-league baseball player who likes to study anatomy , work on motorcycles , and make out with his girlfriend in a public library . \\nwhen doug decides to stop seeing her , melissa maliciously takes revenge on those around him , including his girlfriend , his mother , and his cat . \\ncomments : malicious , i suppose , is an acceptable moview for what it is : a cheap , b-movie thriller which rips off dozens and dozens of spurned-psycho-lover-who-wants-revenge films ( like fatal attraction , hand that rocks the cradle , etc . etc . ) that have come before it . \\nmalicious , however , really doesn't provide very many particularly suspenseful moments . \\nthe plot starts off energetically enough , the main characters are introduced and the affair between doug and melissa begins and ends pretty early on in the film . \\nit starts to drag , unfortunately , after this . \\nmelissa will obviously try to take her revenge on doug ( as always seems to happen in movies like these ) , but she does so in unimaginative ways that have been done in other , better thrillers before . \\nshe drugs someone . \\nshe kills a family pet and leaves it in the girlfriend's apartment . \\nand , of course , she stalks , so we see a number of shots , which are supposed to be suspenseful , where she's spying on doug and his girlfriend . \\ni won't reveal the ludicrous ending to this turkey , but i warn you that it's both painfully obvious and a real yawner . \\njohn vernon does a remarkably good job at playing the not-so-bright baseball jock who initially gets swept away by melissa ( one of the script's faults is to try to pass off a character like this as a pre-med student ) . \\nthe same cannot be said , though , for molly ringwald . \\nat times , she can effectively pull off the obsessed lover routine , especially during her silent , i'm-going-to-stare-you-down scenes . \\nat other times , however , she just seems somehow goofy and out of place . \\nin one particular scene which i guess was supposed to be suspenseful , she screeches \\\" f--k you , you b-----d \\\" and throws a phone . \\nshe delivers the line so ridiculously that one can't help but laugh . \\nmalicious certainly isn't the worst thriller of its kind out in the video racks ( a number of really fat turkies in this genre are out there ) , but it isn't all that good or original either . \\nfeel free to treat this film maliciously , watch something else . \\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"processed_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n
